# Swagger Petstore Sample

## Overview
This is the pet store sample hosted at https://petstore3.swagger.io. For other versions, check the branches.
We welcome suggestion both the code and the API design.
To make changes to the design itself, take a look at https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-petstore/blob/master/src/main/resources/openapi.yaml.

This is a java project to build a stand-alone server which implements the OpenAPI 3 Spec.  You can find out
more about both the spec and the framework at http://swagger.io.

This sample is based on [swagger-inflector](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-inflector), and provides an example of swagger / OpenAPI 3 petstore.

### To run (with Maven)
To run the server, run this task:

```
mvn package jetty:run
```

This will start Jetty embedded on port 8080.

### To run (via Docker)

Expose port 8080 from the image and access petstore via the exposed port. You can then add and delete pets as you see fit.


*Example*:

```
docker build -t swaggerapi/petstore3:unstable .
```

```
docker pull swaggerapi/petstore3:unstable
docker run  --name swaggerapi-petstore3 -d -p 8080:8080 swaggerapi/petstore3:unstable
```


### Testing the server
Once started, you can navigate to http://localhost:8080/api/v3/openapi.json to view the Swagger Resource Listing.
This tells you that the server is up and ready to demonstrate Swagger.

### Using the UI
There is an HTML5-based API tool bundled in this sample--you can view it it at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). This lets you inspect the API using an interactive UI.  You can access the source of this code from [here](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui)

### To run API tests
```
mvn test
```

### To run performance tests (JMeter)
#### Step 1: Download and install JMeter
1. Visit the [Apache JMeter download page](https://jmeter.apache.org/download_jmeter.cgi)
2. Download the latest binary distribution (usually in .tgz format)
3. Extract the downloaded file to a desired location:
```
tar -xvzf apache-jmeter-<version>.tgz
```
#### Step 2: Open JMeter
```
cd apache-jmeter-<version>/bin
```
Start JMeter
```
./jmeter
```
#### 3. Open the test plan and run the test
1. In JMeter click on the open iIcon and select the test plan file for Pet Store performance test "petStore_Test Plan.jmx"(src/test/java/performance)
2. After opening the test plan you will see four listeners (View Results Tree, Summary Report, Aggregate Report and Response Time Graph). Make sure the "Write results to file" path is pointing to the results file available on the projects performance folder (src/test/java/performance/results/test_results.xml)
32. Click on the green **Start** button in the toolbar to run the test.
